# Getting Started {#getting-started}

<Intro>

You're 3 steps away from adding great in-app support to your React Native application.

</Intro>

Guide to integrating the React Native plugin for the Helpshift SDK X.

## Requirements {#version-requirements}

- Node v16 or above
- Android Studio
- Xcode 13 or above
- Java 11 or above

## Download Helpshift React native SDK {#getting-sdk}

#### SDK X - In-app Customer Service {#standard-sdk}

<DownloadButton
  text="Download Plugin"
  link="[% sdkx-react-native.plugin_url %]"
  classes="mb-4"
/>


## Add Helpshift React native plugin to your React Native project {#adding-to-project}

- Add Helpshift react native plugin dependency in your package.json file
- npm i helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native
- After that, re-run your react application and start using Helpshift sdkx functions

### For iOS: Info.plist changes - Addition of usage description strings {#plist-description-strings}

When the “User Attachments” feature is enabled from the In-app SDK Configuration section, the SDK allows the user to upload the attachments. The attachments can be picked from the Photo Library or can be captured directly using the camera. The options for these sources look like:

<Image src="/static/books/sdkx_ios/attachment_picker_ios.png" width="half" />{" "}

To use the camera and photo library, Apple requires the app to have Usage Description strings in the Info.plist while. Failing to add these strings might result in app rejection. The following strings are needed for the attachment feature:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Suggested string</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access photos library to allow users manually pick images
      meant to be sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This is not needed if your app is iOS 11 or above. Below iOS 11, this key
      is compulsory else the app may crash when user tries to open the photo
      library for attaching photos.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSCameraUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access the camera to allow users to click images meant to be
      sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This key is needed for capturing a photo using camera and attaching it.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</td>
    <td>
      “We need to access the microphone to allow users to record videos using
      camera meant to be sent as an attachment for help and support reasons.”
    </td>
    <td>
      This key is needed for capturing a video using camera and attaching it.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that the above strings are just a suggested description. If you need localisations for the same, please Contact Us

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

End-users can attach files such as pdf, video, etc in their issues. For iOS 10 and below, to access files in the “Files” app of iOS, developers will need to add iCloud capability with iCloud Documents services enabled. For more info please refer the [Prerequisites section here.](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/DocumentPickerProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014451)

## Initializing Helpshift in your app {#initializing}

1. First, create an app on the Helpshift Dashboard

   <Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/add_app.png" width="full" />{" "}

2. Create an app with **Android** and **iOS** as selected `Platform`s
   <Image
     src="/static/books/helpshiftx/create_app_with_android_platform.png"
     width="full"
   />{" "}

Helpshift uniquely identifies each registered App with a combination of 2 tokens:

<div className=" compact">

|                          |                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <code>Domain Name</code> | Your Helpshift domain. E.g. _happyapps.helpshift.com_                                      |
| <code>Platform ID</code> | Your App's unique platform id (App's <code>App Id</code> on dashboard is your platform Id) |

</div>
You can find these by navigating to `Settings`>`SDK (for Developers)` in your agent dashboard.
Select your App and _check Android as a platform_ from the dropdowns and copy
the 2 tokens to be passed when initializing Helpshift.
<Image src="/static/books/helpshiftx/copy_install_keys.png"  width="full" />

You should now import `install` function from `helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native` -> Helpshift SDK and configure your specific project fields. Copy the `domain` and `platformId` from the dashboard.


Call the `install` function before any other interaction with the Helpshift SDK (preferably in the useEffect() callback in react native call)

The `install` call takes a 3 parameters. out of which appid and domain is mendatory and config parameter is optional, which means you can pass an empty map. The meaning of different keys and their possible values for Android and iOS can be found [here](/sdkx-react-native/sdk-configuration)

### Initialize
```
// Import the methods required for your integration.
// You can refer the index.tsx file to see the methods available
// to import. In this example, we are not importing all the
// methods.

import {
  install,
  showConversation,
  showFAQsWithConfig,
  logout,
  login
} from 'helpshift-plugin-sdkx-react-native';
```
### Install
```
let installConfig = {
  'enableLogging': true,
  'manualLifecycleTracking': false
}
let appId = Platform.select({
  android: <Android_Platform_Id>,
  ios: <iOS_Platform_Id>,
});

if (appId != null) {
  install(appId, <domain>, installConfig);
} else {
  //Display your error here.
}
```

## Start using Helpshift {#start-using}

Helpshift is now integrated with your app. You should now use the support APIs for [conversation screens](/sdkx-react-native/support-tools#conversation-view) inside your app.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">

Since the Helpshift plugin is meant for mobile devices only, you should put all Helpshift calls inside conditional checks to make sure they are only called when running on a device.
